# gutenberg-multyblock-setup
Perfect setup for multiple blocks in one plugin

```
npx @wordpress/create-block@latest
```

Does not provide multiple blocks by default. This is why I decided to craete my own setup so I do not repeat my self. 

## Scripts: 

1. Create new block
2. Build (Production)
3. Start (Watch changes)
4. Server (Run local server)
5. Develop (Run local server and watch changes)
6. Update scripts
